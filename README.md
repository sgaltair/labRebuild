# Rebuilding My Docker Lab

I decided to rebuild my lab environment, as I had pieced it together as I was learning and it was definitely not done the right way. 

This purpose of this repo was to track my progress and process as I made these changes. 

All containers besides VSFPTD are now behind nginx-proxy, providing a reverse proxy and automatic SSL certs.

# Now what?
As my stack and lab evolve I will continue to keep this updated for reference and posterity.
